	1. We need to recognise the problem with Q10 not being linear (always) on the log scale in the main MS, but recognise that, a priori, it should be equivalent when the temperatures are manipulated within the natural range (i.e., up to Topt) of the species' temperatures. However, this is a problem with all studies using Q10 and is challenging to address without full performance curves for a species, which nearly never exist.
	
	2. Statistical and data driven solutions. We can address this issue with a few additional analyses and data explorations that include:
		1. Take the maximum temperature of the experimental manipulations and include this temperature in the models. The expectation is fairly straight forward. Q10 should be underestimated for species that have pushed the treatments to the higher temperatures because theory would suggest that we may have crossed Topt and so rates begin to decrease. 
		2. Explore the lowest 25% of Q10 values to understand if these studies have high relative tempereatures compared to the Topt for the species or if they have abnormally high temps. Lab and wild can be used.
		3. Using wild populations, extract the temperature time series across the year (range, mean, SD) and compare the temperature manipulations done in the study to those in nature. Do they fall within the range? How far are they from their upper temperatures?
		4. Using the difference between the upper temperatures in nature to the upper temperature of the experiment, include this as a moderator to explore if the deviation from natural conditions covaries with Q10. 

R1, R2 and R3. All make statements about introduction needing to better develop why interindividual variability should differ between freshwater, marine and terrestrial habitats. Also R1 suggests re-organising which I agree
