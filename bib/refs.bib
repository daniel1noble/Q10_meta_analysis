@article{Hedges1992-sf,
	abstract = {The use of statistical methods to combine the results of
               independent empirical research studies (meta-analysis) has a
               long history. Meta-analytic work can be divided into two
               traditions: tests of the statistical significance of combined
               results and methods for combining estimates across studies. The
               principal classes of combined significance tests are reviewed,
               and the limitations of these tests are discussed. Fixed effects
               approaches treat the effect magnitude parameters to be estimated
               as a consequence of a model involving fixed but unknown
               constants. Random effects approaches treat effect magnitude
               parameters as if they were sampled from a universe of effects
               and attempt to estimate the mean and variance of the
               hyperpopulation of effects. Mixed models incorporate both fixed
               and random effects. Finally, areas of current research are
               summarized, including methods for handling missing data, models
               for publication selection, models to handle studies that are not
               independent, and distribution-free models for random effects.},

               harmless to venomous, lizards are spectacular products of
               natural selection. This book, lavishly illustrated with color
               photographs, is the first comprehensive reference on lizards
               around the world. Accessible, scientifically up-to-date, and
               written with contagious enthusiasm for the subject, Lizards:
               Windows to the Evolution of Diversity covers species evolution,
               diversity, ecology, and biology. Eric R. Pianka and Laurie J.
               Vitt have studied and photographed members of almost all lizard
               families worldwide, and they bring to the book a deep knowledge
               based on extensive firsthand experience with the animals in
               their natural habitats.Part One explores lizard lifestyles,
               answering such questions as why lizards are active when they
               are, why they behave as they do, how they avoid predators, why
               they eat what they eat, and how they reproduce and socialize. In
               Part Two the authors take us on a fascinating tour of the
               world's manifold lizard species, beginning with iguanians, an
               evolutionary group that includes some of the most bizarre
               lizards, the true chameleons of Africa and Madagascar. We also
               meet the glass lizard, able to break its tail into many highly
               motile pieces to distract a predator from its body; lizards that
               can run across water; and limbless lizards, such as snakes. Part
               Three gives an unprecedented global view of evolutionary trends
               that have shaped present-day lizard communities and considers
               the impact of humans on their future.A definitive resource
               containing many entertaining anecdotes, this magnificent book
               opens a new window to the natural world and the evolution of
               life on earth.},
